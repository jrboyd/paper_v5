ngs plots and membership heatmaps relating uniquely to gsea

run a compare pipeline to determine which gsea lists are significant.

run corresponding ngs_profiles pipeline after comparing to plot ngs profiles with the bait (uniquely marked genes that are enriched in gsea) masked and plotted in background.

gene_overlap plots membership tables, intersecting uniquely and gsea.

text_mining is experimental word clouds based on gsea descriptions.
